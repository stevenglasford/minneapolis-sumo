This repository was created to inspect and model real traffic in the city of 
Minneapolis, MN using data from different government sources to include
vehicle capacity per day, foor traffic trips in the city, and data from
the Metropolitian Council in an effort to test a new type of city grid
overlay called "Remove Three". There is a document in this repo that explains
more of this as well as serving as the basis for a letter to legistature of
Minnesota, the Metropolitian Council, and the city council of Minneapolis.

The goal of this project is to increase pedestrian safety regardless of
weather and placement within the city of Minneapolis. But in an attempt
to quell fears of a transit/bike takeover an attempt is made to save all
current street parking placements, furthermore, the basis of this is to
provide a plan that benefits all forms of traffic in the city in a
demonstrable and detectable fashion. I am unsure if this "Remove Three"
plan will work but I hope it does as doing so would increase safety,
reduce congestion, and improve air quality, improve bicycle safety,
provide for accodations for winter/northern cities, improve transit in the
city of Minneapolis.
